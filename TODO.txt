Graph of arrested persons is actually ~25 disconnected graphs,
one per arrest event. Not much to play with. Could write 
something that looks for any individual that might be 
present in multiple arrest events? Need some crit for 
deciding two people are actually the same person.... start
really broad to see if there's anything at all.

TODO:
    -run arrested persons social network code with updated
     db export. 
    -set up api call so code pulls upto date stuff straight
     from nodegoat

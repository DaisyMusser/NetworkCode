In networkX nodes and edges can be whatever you want...
 - Could make objects representing ppl be the nodes
 - and objects representing arrest events be the edges

Use multigraph instead of graph. This allows the same two 
nodes to be connected by multiple edges. We need this because
the same people can be arrested together multiple times.

A lot of algorthms don't work on multigraphs. To use these,
convert back to graph and then run algorithm.

Graph of arrested persons is actually ~25 disconnected graphs,
one per arrest event. Not much to play with. Could write 
something that looks for any individual that might be 
present in multiple arrest events? Need some crit for 
deciding two people are actually the same person.... start
really broad to see if there's anything at all.

TODO:
    -run arrested persons social network code with updated
     db export. 
    -set up api call so code pulls upto date stuff straight
     from nodegoat
